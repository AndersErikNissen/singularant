# Singularant - A small Nuxt 3 project
A small project I have created based on a logo I made in 2024, build using the Valorant-API for almost all the data.

### The design
The design ended up being based on the logo itself, and the idea of trying out a very boxed design.
The design took shame as I went along, but I could just as easily have made a Figma design file - but the purpose was to learn Nuxt, so that is why Figma was skipped.

### The code
I also ended up being a great project for me to start learning Nuxt 3.
Prior I only had some experience with Vue 2, from back in the day (2021), so it was fun learning all the improvements that have happened since.
